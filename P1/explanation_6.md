# Data Structure
A linked list with a dictionary to help check if an item exists between two sets are used to implement this.

# Time Complexity
It requires two loops to calculate the union or intersection of two lists. Given 'n' and 'm' as the sizes of two linked list, 
the time complexity is O(n+m), but can be just denoted as O(n)

# Space Complexity
The space of linked list and dictionary is porportional to the input linked lists. Given 'n' and 'm' as the sizes of two linked list, 
the space complexity is O(n+m), but can be just denoted as O(n)
