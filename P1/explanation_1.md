# Data Structure
The cache is a double linked list to allow efficient operation.

# Time Complexity
By using a doubly linked list along with a dictionary, the code achieves constant-time operations. 
Therefore, it is O(1) time complexity

# Space Complexity
The size of double linked list and dictonary is proportional to the given capacity of the cache. 
Therefore the space complexity is O(n)
