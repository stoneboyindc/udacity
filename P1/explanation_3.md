# Data Structure
tuple, list, tree are used to support Huffman encoding algorithm implementation

# Time Complexity
There is a loop in each step to perform the frequency counting/building tree/encoding/decoding. 
Therefore, given 'n' as the length of data, the time complexity is O(n)

# Space Complexity
The size of tuple, list, and tree are linear proportional to the size of input data. 
Therefore,  given 'n' as the length of data, the space complexity is O(n)
