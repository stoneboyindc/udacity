# Data Structure
Block chain's structure fits the characteristic of a linked list. Therefore, linked list is used to implement it. 

# Time Complexity
Adding a block into a block chain is constant, which is O(1) time complexity

# Space Complexity
The space needed to hold a block chain is porportional to the number 'n' of blocks that need to be inserted. 
Therefore, its time complexity is O(n)
