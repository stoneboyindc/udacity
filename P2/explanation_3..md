# Data Structure
It uses quickSort algorithm to sort the input array, and then pick the element in alternative position to form two largest integers.

# Time Complexity
Given 'n' as the size of the input array, the worst time it takes to do the sorting is O(n^n) as it is using quickSort algorithm where in the worst case, the number of swapping operation is O^n

# Space Complexity
It uses a single space to hold the target, and therefore, it is O(1)
