# Data Structure
It uses three pointers to mark the position of each segments

# Time Complexity
Given 'n' as the size of the input array, the worst time it takes to do the sorting is O(n) as it is just doing a single loop.

# Space Complexity
Given 'n' as the size of the input array, it uses fixed numbers of pointers to do the in place sorting. Therefore, it is O(1)
