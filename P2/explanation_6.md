# Data Structure
It uses a single scan to find the min and max values in an array.

# Time Complexity
Given 'n' as the size of the input array, it is a single loop scanning and is O(n).

# Space Complexity
Given 'n' as the size of the input array, it needs the same amount of space (2 variables per time). Therefore, it is O(1)
