# Data Structure
It uses binarySearch algorithm to find the pivot value and divide the array into two sections. In the targeted section, use binarySearch again to locate the target

# Time Complexity
Given 'n' as the size of the input array, the time it takes to find the target is O(log(n)) as it is using binarySearch algorithm

# Space Complexity
It uses a single space to hold the target, and therefore, it is O(1)
